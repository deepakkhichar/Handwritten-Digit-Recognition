- src folder contains the code for both part 1 and part 2.
- Problem_1.py in the src folder contains the whole code for problem 1 and Problem_2.py in the src folder contains the whole code for Problem_2.
- Problem_1_part_A.ipynb contains the implemented notebook of Problem 1 part A
- Problem_1_part_B_1.ipynb contains the implemented notebook of Problem 1 part B L2 Regularization
- Problem_1_part_B_2.ipynb contains the implemented notebook of Problem 1 part B Dropout
- Problem_1_part_B_3.ipynb contains the implemented notebook of Problem 1 part B Early Stoppage
